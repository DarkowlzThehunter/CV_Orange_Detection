# Computer Vision Mini-Project: Orange Detection

Welcome to the Computer Vision Mini-Project repository! This repository is dedicated to submitting the Computer Vision Mini-project. 
This project focuses on detecting oranges in both images and videos using computer vision techniques.

## Contents

- `CV_Orange_Detection_Pic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for detecting oranges in a picture.
- `CV_Orange_Detection_Pic.py`: Python script for detecting oranges in a picture.
- `CV_Orange_Detection_Video.py`: Python script for detecting oranges in a video.

## Description

This project aims to develop algorithms to identify oranges within images and video streams. The provided scripts utilize computer vision techniques to detect and highlight oranges, enabling various applications such as fruit sorting, image processing, and more.

## Usage

- **CV_Orange_Detection_Pic.ipynb**: Open this notebook using Jupyter to run the orange detection algorithm on a single image.
- **CV_Orange_Detection_Video.py**: Execute this Python script to apply the orange detection algorithm to a video file.
